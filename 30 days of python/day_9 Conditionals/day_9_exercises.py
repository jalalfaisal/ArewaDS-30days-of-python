#Exercises: Level 1
#Get user input using input(“Enter your age: ”). If user is 18 or older, give feedback: You are old enough to drive. If below 18 give feedback to wait for the missing amount of years. Output:
age = int(input("please enter your age:"))
if age >= 18:
  print("congratulation you're old enough to drive in any part in nigeria")
else:
  print("please wait for", 18 -age, "missing amount of years you can't drive now in any part of nigeria")
#Compare the values of my_age and your_age using if … else. Who is older (me or you)? Use input(“Enter your age: ”) to get the age as input. You can use a nested condition to print 'year' for 1 year difference in age, 'years' for bigger differences, and a custom text if my_age = your_age. Output:
my_age = 27
your_age = int(input("please enter your age:"))
if my_age == your_age:
    print("Thank God we're at the same age" )
